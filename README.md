# FrontendMovieAPI
Simple frontend assignment - OMDB and YouTube API fetch data (in progress)
Display mvoies by chosen category using OMDB and YouTube APIs.  
Requirements:
- Display minimum 6 movies by category of our choice. 
- We should display movies details such as director, year released, plot, etc.
- A trailer from YouTube should be included.
- Use API to get the data above.
- The only hard-coded values alowed are the movie titles.
- No frameworks (libraries alowed only after teacher's approval and reason of usage- why are we using them?)

What we will use:
- Fetch to connect to an API (fetch vs XMLHttpRequest vs jQuery)
- Using template literals (backtick templates) for adding content to the DOM
